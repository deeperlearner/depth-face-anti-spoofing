# Dataset


# Method
The idea is that using DQNet model to predict the depth of face and use the mean of the predicted detph as output score.
By using `depth_face.sh`, we can generate the ground truth depth of real face.
And the depth of a spoof face is an all zero image.
After training DQNet for a few epochs, we add an auxiliary branch to train a binary classification to output real or spoof face.

# Reference
* The depth of real face is generated by [3DDFA_V2](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2).
* The DQNet structure is borrowed from [Face De-Spoofing: Anti-Spoofing via Noise Modeling](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Yaojie_Liu_Face_De-spoofing_ECCV_2018_paper.html).
